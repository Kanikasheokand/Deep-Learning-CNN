# Deep Learning-CNN

This excercise is part of module fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization,understand how computer vision has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition, image segmentation, reading radiology images, and more.

Gained knowledge how convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks; apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks; and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.
